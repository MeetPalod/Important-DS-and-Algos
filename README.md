# Basic Concepts

1. Single source shortest path on unweighted graphs - Use BFS   ( DFS can be used for trees.)
2. A graph is a tree if it has 1 connected component and no of edges is n-1.
3. Min distance between two node in binary tree. Find LCA. (https://ideone.com/FNZSfD)


# Helpful Tips 
1. If it is a grid question,check if dfs or bfs can help.
2. While taking mod, use (n+mod)%mod .  It will take care of negative values of n.
3.
